**Build Status**

Current version: v0.92 bn 32

**Introduction**

An Open Source photogrammetric platform for 3d reconstruction from multiple images. The photographic dream of modeling the world in 3D at scale only using photographs comes true. GRAPHOS has been conceived as a platform that integrates the best and most robust algorithms in photogrammetry and computer vision for achieving flexibility (coping with any type of images and camera), automation (passing from 2D to 3D with one click) and quality (guaranteeing high resolution and accuracy).
